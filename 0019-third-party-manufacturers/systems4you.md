We are open to send a unit for audit if needed.

We plan to build our own radio modules/concentrators based on the Semtech design.

## Manufacturing Information

* Have you built gateways before? Yes, but not using LoRa.
* How many gateways did you make? Small quantities directly to our industrial customers.

## Budget & Capital

## Risks & Challenges

The chip shortage would be one of the only challenge that we can see coming up. 

We will plan accordingly and will never promise to deliver if we can’t.

We will have constant updates on our site.
